Challenges:
the challenge was to create a cocktail finder based on an API that was provided to us.
For this, functions and events were created in js.

Basic requirement:

. A list of search results where the image of the cocktail and the name appear.
. Once the search results appear, the user can indicate which are our cocktails
favorites.

```

. An option to delete favorites by clicking on the icon.
. A reset button.
. Add/remove as favorite when doing click on the image.
